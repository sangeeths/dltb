DLTB = Download tamilbeat.com
       ^   ^    ^    ^


INTRODUCTION:
As a lazy tamilbeat.com user, I find it very hard 
to right-click on each hyper-link to save the mp3
files. I wish there is a better way! My frustration
made me to write this script!!

So, for a given URL, dltb will browse it, identify 
all the hyper-links for mp3 files and downloads 
them to your hdd.


USAGE:
dltb [-c|--crawl]
     [-d|--debug]
     [-l|--log <filename>]
     [-u|--url <url>]

-c|--crawl        After downloading mp3's, explore this
                  webpage and crawl the hyperlinks to
                  find more mp3's; Default: off

-d|--debug        Turn debug on; Default: off

-l|--log <file>   Enable logging to <file>; Default: off

-u|--url          Tamilbeat url;
                  Default: http://www.tamilbeat.com/tamilsongs


EXAMPLE:
1. To download _all_ the mp3 songs available in tamilbeat.com, 
   do the following! It will take 3-5 hours and you may need 
   15-17G for hdd space.

    ./dltb -u http://www.tamilbeat.com
2. To download _all_songs_of_a_particular_movie, do the 
   following:
    ./dltb -u <tamilbeat-url-for-that-movie>
    ./dltb -u http://www.tamilbeat.com/tamilsongs/inter/TajMahal/
[see -d, -l and -c options below]


TODO:
- Ability to run multiple instances.. multi-threads
- Make a chrome extension for this! 
- Error checking and descriptive error messages


LOG:
To get the logs written into a file, use -l | --log 
option followed by the log file name. When the log
file name is not give, the default value "log_dltb"
will be assumed.


DEBUG:
To run this script in the debug mode, use -d | --debug
option in the command line.


CRAWL:
To further crawl the given url (to search for potential
mp3 downloads), use -c | --crawl option in the command
line.
