INTRODUCTION:
As a lazy tamilbeat.com user, I find it very hard 
to right-click on each hyper-link to save the mp3
files. I wish there is a better way! My frustration
made me to write this script!!

So, for a given URL, dltb will browse it, identify 
all the hyper-links for mp3 files and downloads 
them to your hdd.


USAGE:
./dltb <tamilbeat.com URL>


EXAMPLE:
To download _all_ the mp3 songs available in tamilbeat.com, 
do the following! It will take 3-5 hours and you may need 
15-17G for hdd space.
./dltb http://www.tamilat.com/tamilsongs

To download _all_songs_of_a_particular_movie, do the 
following:
./dltb <tamilbeat-url-for-that-movie>
./dltb http://www.tamilbeat.com/tamilsongs/inter/TajMahal/


TODO:
- Ability to run multiple instances.. multi-threads
- Introduce a blacklist (set of website which should
  not be crawled - inorder to save time) - for example
  http://www.melisai.com/gallery/ 
- Make a chrome extension for this! 
- Error checking and descriptive error messages
- Logs
- Interactive - If there are 5 songs in the given URL, 
  then download them and ask "should I crawl this page?"
  if yes, then crawl, else halt
